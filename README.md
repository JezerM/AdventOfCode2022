I started to learn Rust with the 2022 edition of AdventOfCode. That's it.

This repo provides the source code for each day (yet to complete) along with the `text.txt` and `input.txt` files. The first one contains the example provided by AdventOfCode, while the last one contains the input provided to me (yours should be different).

Run with `cargo run`, and test with `cargo test`.
